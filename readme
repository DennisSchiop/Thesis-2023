## Introduction

Introduction:

The market for designer sneakers has grown exponentially in recent years, fueled by the increasing demand for limited edition releases and collaborations between high-profile brands and celebrities. With this growing demand comes an unfortunate increase in counterfeit products and fraudulent transactions. Buyers often struggle to verify the authenticity and provenance of designer sneakers, and sellers face challenges in protecting their products and reputations.

The motivation behind this project is to address these issues by developing a React Native app that utilizes QR codes and blockchain technology to secure the authenticity and ownership of designer sneakers. By leveraging these technologies, we aim to create a trustworthy ecosystem that benefits both buyers and sellers while eliminating the risks associated with counterfeiting and fraud.

This project solves the following problems:

1. Authenticity Verification: The app enables users to easily verify the authenticity of designer sneakers by scanning QR codes embedded in the sneakers. These QR codes store immutable data on a blockchain, ensuring the accuracy and security of the information.

2. Ownership Tracking: The blockchain technology used in this app allows for transparent tracking of ownership and transaction history. This feature not only assures buyers of the sneakers' provenance but also helps to maintain the value of limited edition releases.

3. Decentralization and Security: By utilizing a decentralized blockchain network, the app ensures that no single entity has control over the information. This protects the system from tampering and data manipulation while providing a secure and reliable source of information for all users.

The benefits of using blockchain technology for safeguarding designer sneakers include:

1. Enhanced Trust: Blockchain technology promotes trust among users by providing an immutable, transparent, and secure platform for verifying the authenticity and ownership of designer sneakers.

2. Reduced Counterfeiting: The combination of QR codes and blockchain technology makes it extremely difficult for counterfeiters to replicate authentic products or manipulate ownership records, thereby reducing the prevalence of counterfeit sneakers in the market.
